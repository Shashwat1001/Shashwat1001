Hi thereüëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile, I am Shashwat Shankar and I am an enthusiastic consumer of knowledge, highly impassioned for cutting edge technologies and research, and deeply motivated to apply my skills in the real-life project which can impact people.ü§©‚úåÔ∏è

My current learning and project explorations are in these domains:

‚Ä¢ Quantum Computing & Quantum Information Science.

‚Ä¢ Artificial Intelligence- Reinforcement Learning (RL),AI at Edge.

‚Ä¢ Machine Learning- Statistical Machine Learning techniques and Algorithms.

‚Ä¢ Data Science- Data Mining, Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling.

‚Ä¢ Deep Learning- ANN, CNN, RNN

‚Ä¢ Computer Vision- Color Vision & Visual Recognition.

From small solo projects to production level creative collaborations in my most pertinent skills, I have always looked for the chance to explore new venues and learn something new that I can apply to my work. I firmly believe that hard work eventually pays off, and I know that each day brings me closer to reaching my goals.
